# NES Demos
## Summary
A compilation of NES source code to be used for learning how to do basic things in assembly or C for the 6502.

When downloading this repo you will get the nesasm to be used to compile the code in Windows (NESASM.exe) or macOS (nesasm). All assembly code has the extension 'asm' and the C code ends with 'c'. It is also possible to go to github and download a more recent version of nesasm and compile it for your machine.

The project also includes a chr file which has the graphics data for both the sprites and background. To open and edit the chr file you will need yy-chr which is a windows only application.
